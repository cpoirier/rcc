    # RCC Grammar Grammar
    #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # Grammar files are arranged in four sections: configuration, terminals, rules, and a precedence table.  The latter three
    # can optionally be arranged inside multiple groups, if it helps clarify your grammar.
    #
    # Quick example:
    #    Grammar <name>
    #       StartRule string
    #    
    #       Group strings
    #          Terminals 
    #             escape_sequence => /\\./
    #             general_text    => /[^"\\{]+/
    #          end
    #       
    #          Rules
    #             string          => '"' string_body '"'
    #             
    #             string_body     => string_element
    #                             => string_body string_element
    #                             
    #             string_element  => escape_sequence
    #                             => general_text
    #                             => '{' expression '}'
    #          end
    #       end
    #    end
    #
    #
    # Grammar
    # -------
    # The Grammar section wraps the whole grammar and gives it a name.  At the top of the Grammar, you can specify configuration
    # settings that control how rcc does its work.  These settings are defaults, and can be overridden on the command line
    # (generally). 
    #
    # Example:
    #    Grammar <name>
    #       StartRule <rule name>
    #       
    #       Terminals
    #       end
    #   
    #       Rules
    #       end
    #  
    #       Precedence
    #       end
    #    end
    #
    # Current configuration directives:
    #    StartRule <rule name>          -- provides name of the rule that starts the grammar
    #    IgnoreTerminal <terminal name> -- specifies the name of a Terminal that should be discarded by the lexer
    #                                   -- useful for getting rid of whitespace and comments, for instance
    #                                   -- include as many IgnoreTerminal directives as necessary
    #
    #
    # Group
    # -----
    # The Group section can be used if you'd like to divide your grammar up into multiple sets of Terminals/Rules/Precedence 
    # sections.  Groups are for documentation purposes only, and do not affect how your grammar works.  If you don't use a Group,
    # you can use only one each of the Terminals/Rules/Precedence declaration sections.
    #
    # Example:
    #    Grammar <name>
    #       Group code
    #          Terminals
    #          end
    #         
    #          Rules
    #          end
    #       
    #          Precedence
    #          end
    #       end
    #
    #       Group strings
    #          Terminals
    #          end
    #         
    #          Rules
    #          end
    #       
    #          Precedence
    #          end
    #       end
    #    end
    #    
    #
    # Terminals
    # ---------
    # Simple terminals (literal symbols that appear in the text of your program) can be defined directly in the rules.  However,
    # for more complicated things (identifiers, numbers, etc.), you'll need to specify them here.  You can use regular 
    # expressions or literal strings, and the name you assign them will be used as the generated Token type.
    #
    # As a rule, the lexer will search for literal strings first, then try your patterns, in the declaration order.  However,
    # the parser will automatically prioritize those literals and patterns it expects to find on the lookahead for the current
    # state, so you can have, for instance, two or more overlapping regular expressions, and the parser will choose the 
    # appropriate one for the context (where possible).
    #
    # Example:
    #    Terminals
    #       id  => /[a-zA-Z]\w+/
    #       eos => "\n"
    #    end
    #
    #
    # Rules
    # -----
    # The rules section contains the actual grammar definition.  Individual rules can have multiple forms.  With rcc, you don't
    # include semantic actions in the rules; instead, the generated parser calls methods on itself (or your subclass), named
    # for the rule.  You can specify a form-specific label as a property after the form, and that label will be used instead of 
    # the rule name when calling the handler routine.  It also identifies the form for use in precedence lists.  Note that such 
    # labels share the same namespace as rule names and must be unique.
    #
    # Properties are defined at the end of the same line as the rule form, marked with curly braces.  As just mentioned, the
    # default property is a form label, but you can supply other data as name=value pairs (each in their own pair of braces).  
    # 
    # Supported properties:
    #    label - the label to apply to the form for purpose of identification in Precedence rules
    #          - label is the default property, so you don't need to use "label="
    #    assoc - the associativity for binary forms (left, right, or none; defaults to none; further discussion below)
    #
    # Example:
    #    Rules
    #       statement => expression eos:ignore
    #    
    #       expression 
    #          => expression:lhs '+' eos:ignore? expression:rhs     {addition_expression}       {assoc=left}
    #          => expression '-' eos? expression                    {subtraction_expression}    {assoc=left}
    #          => expression '*' eos? expression                    {multiplication_expression} {assoc=left} 
    #          => expression '/' eos? expression                    {division_expression}       {assoc=left}
    #          => '-' expression                                    {negation_expression}
    #          => relation                                          {relation_expression}
    #          => predicate                                         {predicate_expression}
    #          => id
    #    end
    #
    # Rules contain a mix of names and simple terminals.  Names not defined as Terminals in the Terminals section are Rule names.  
    # Simple terminals can be written directly in rules using single or double quotes.
    #
    # The rcc system supports some syntactic sugar for grammars.  The first is the ability to use alternate literals within a 
    # single rule.  The second is the ability to mark a symbol as optional.  
    #
    # Example rule:
    #   intersection => relation ('intersect'|'âˆ©') eos? relation
    #
    # In this example, the user can type the symbol or name for the "interesect" operator, and either will be accepted.  Use 
    # parentheses to group the options and the pipe symbol (|) to separate them.  Note also that you can only use this form with 
    # literals.  For anything more complicated, make additional rules.
    # 
    # Also in this example, the "eos" terminal has been marked as optional.  This means that it can be included immediately 
    # after the operator without terminating the statement, but will not generate an error if it is missing.  You can mark any 
    # rule element as optional.  In an rcc-produced AST, any missing slots will be nil.
    #
    #
    # AST Construction and Term Labels
    # --------------------------------
    # In the above example, you will notice that some of the Rule terms include a : label.  This label is used when assigning the
    # data to a slot in the AST.  For instance, in the first "expression" form above, the first expression will be available in
    # slot "lhs" and the second in slot "rhs" on AST class "addition_expression".
    #
    # If you don't specify labels for any of your terms, rcc will assign labels for you.  Generally speaking, these labels will
    # be based on the terms themselves.  For instance, in the second "expression" form above, the first expression will be 
    # available in slot "expression1" and the second in slot "expression2" on AST class "subtraction_expression".  For the 
    # "negation_expression", the expression term will be available in slot "expression", as there is no contention for the name
    # in that form.  
    #
    # rcc automatically assigns labels to any unlabeled non-terminals in your rules.  It does not automatically supply labels 
    # for literals, as they are assumed to be uninteresting in the AST.  You can override this behaviour by supplying an explicit
    # label of your own.  The "ignore" label is special, and has the opposite effect: any term labelled "ignore" will not get
    # a slot in the AST class.
    #
    #
    # Conflicts and Associativity
    # ---------------------------
    # rcc generates LALR(k) parsers.  Basically, what this means is that the parser reads tokens onto a stack until it recognizes 
    # something at the top of the stack that matches a Rule.  It then pops the relevant tokens off the top of the stack, applies
    # the Rule, then pushes the Rule result back onto the stack for use in future matches.
    #
    # Because the parser is working this way, it has the choice to defer or prioritize reductions, should it make sense to do so.  
    # One place this comes into play is associativity.  Consider this basic math expression:
    #    1 + 2 - 3
    #
    # This expression can be grouped in one of two ways: (1 + 2) - 3  OR  1 + (2 - 3).  Now, in basic math, the two options just
    # happen to have the same meaning, but it shows the concept of associativity: the first parse is "left" associative; the 
    # second is "right" associative. 
    # 
    # By default, LR parsers treat all rules as right-associative: shifts are prioritized over reduces, given an option.  But
    # this is not always ideal.  While it doesn't matter in our simple example, in real life, basic math is defined as left-
    # associative.  If, say, those terms were function calls instead of numbers, you would want the evaluation to proceed from 
    # left to right, to ensure that any side-effects from those functions occur the in order your user is expecting.  
    #
    # rcc supports three associativities: left, right, and none.  For left associativity, the left-most match will be reduced 
    # first.  For right associativity, the right-most match will be reduced first.  For non-associativity, no repeating of
    # a form is allowed.  This last option is useful if you want to force associativity to be explicitly chosen by the user:
    # ie. "1 + 2 + 3" would have to be written either as "(1 + 2) + 3" or "1 + (2 + 3)", in order to be accepted by the parser.  
    #
    # You specify associativity as a property on the rule form (see above).
    #
    #
    # Conflicts and Precedence
    # ------------------------
    # In the previous section, we discussed how the associativity of rules can control when to shift and when to reduce.  This
    # implies that the parser had a choice: that, in fact, it was in a state where it could (and therefore had to) choose between
    # a shift and a reduce.  
    #
    # Real grammars often have many such conflicts between rules.  Associativity can help solve some of those conflicts, but
    # other tools can be useful, too.
    # 
    # Consider the following grammar:
    #   expression => number
    #              => expression '*' expression   {assoc=left} {multiplication_expression}
    #              => expression '/' expression   {assoc=left} {division_expression}
    #              => expression '+' expression   {assoc=left} {addition_expression}
    #              => expression '-' expression   {assoc=left} {subtraction_expression}
    #
    # This grammar expresses basic math on numbers, in that it has the four basic operators and marks them all as left-
    # associative.  But there's a wrinkle: in real math, multiplication and division must be done BEFORE addition and subtraction.  
    # That's a significant complication, and associativity alone is not enough to solve it.  We could find a way to rewrite the 
    # grammar, to express those relationship, but that would probably make our grammar less readable, not more so.
    #
    # What we really need is to be able to express a precedence relationship between these forms.  This is done using a 
    # Precedence section.
    # 
    # Example:
    #    Precedence
    #      multiplication_expression division_expression
    #      addition_expression       subtraction_expression
    #    end
    #
    # Within a Precedence section, each line indicates rules or forms (by name or label) that should be treated as having equal
    # precedence.  Lines earlier in the section indicate higher precedence than lines later in the section.
    #
    # You can have multiple Precedence sections, each of which indicates a closed set of relationships.  When resolving 
    # shift/reduce conflicts between rules that appear in the same section, precedence will be used.  When resolving shift/reduce
    # conflicts between rules that do not appear in the same Precedence section, precedence will not be used.
    #
